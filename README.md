# VocaVoca

Vocavoca is a project developed as an activity of the Sugar Learning Platform utilizing the Sugarizer implementation. See https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer for more information on Sugarizer. It is basically a game that aims to familiarize the kids with a basic English vocabulary. Only Spanish version is provided now. But the final goal is a basic English learning tool for all kids, regardless of his or her first language, without or with little access to English classes or teachers.

## Vocabury Database
You can contribute by expanding the vocabulary now we have. All the vocabulary are organized in different themes, for example animals, family, etc. And for every word we need a .jpg with size approximately 400*300 and .mp3 file. These are put in pics/ and audio/ folders respectively. Also database.js should be modified to register any newly added vocabulary.

## Libraries Used
1. Bootstray (http://getbootstrap.com/)
